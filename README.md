## Installation

1. Ensure you have Neovim installed (version 0.10.1 or later required for Avante.nvim)
2. Install ripgrep for optimal Telescope performance:

   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install ripgrep
   
   # For macOS
   brew install ripgrep
   
   # For Windows (with Chocolatey)
   choco install ripgrep
   ```

3. Clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

4. Create the templates directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/templates
   ```

5. Copy the skeleton.md template to the templates directory.

6. Get an Anthropic API key (for Claude 3.7) from [Anthropic's website](https://console.anthropic.com/).

7. Launch Neovim. The lazy.nvim package manager will automatically install the plugins:

   ```bash
   nvim
   ```

## Core Features

### Seoul256 Color Scheme

A low-contrast color scheme that's easy on the eyes for extended editing sessions.

```lua
vim.opt.background = "dark"
vim.cmd([[colorscheme seoul256]])
```

### Markdown Workflow

Enhanced markdown editing powered by mkdnflow.nvim:

- Navigate between headings with `[[` and `]]`
- Follow links with `<CR>` or `<leader>fl`
- Create links with `<leader>cl`
- Jump between links with `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>`
- Navigate back/forward with `<BS>` and `<Del>`
- Toggle to-do items with `<leader>tt`

The configuration includes special handling for wiki-style links `[[Like This]]` and standard markdown links `[Like This](like-this.md)`.

### Link Management

Intelligent link management with:

- Automatic link transformation (spaces â†’ dashes, lowercase)
- Link concealing for cleaner document viewing
- Quick insertion shortcuts:
  - `;l` inserts `[]()`
  - `;w` inserts `[[]]`
- `<M-]>` moves past closing `]]`
- Custom completion for file links

### Backlinks System

Track references to your notes with:

- `<leader>bl`: Find all backlinks to the current file
- Automatic backlinks section in templates
- Automatic file saving when navigating (via autowriteall)

### Status Management

Track the progress of your notes with a custom status system:

- **unread**: Indicates that the file has not been read yet. It is typically used for notes or documents that the user intends to review later.
- **wip** (Work In Progress): Signifies that the file is still being worked on. It may contain incomplete thoughts, drafts, or ongoing projects that require further development.
- **complete**: Indicates that the file is finished and no further changes are expected. It is used for finalized notes or documents that are ready for reference or sharing.
- **delete**: Marks files that are candidates for deletion. This status helps identify content that is no longer needed or relevant but allows for review before permanent removal.

- Filter files by status (unread, wip, complete, delete)
- Count files by status with `<leader>ss`
- Change status directly from filter view with `<C-s>`
- View all statuses with `<leader>sa`

Key mappings:
- `<leader>su`: Show unread files
- `<leader>sw`: Show work-in-progress files
- `<leader>sc`: Show completed files
- `<leader>sd`: Show files marked for deletion

### Templating System

Create structured notes with a flexible templating system:

- Store templates in `~/.config/nvim/templates/`
- Apply templates with `<leader>t` or `:Template filename.md`
- Create new files with templates using `<leader>n` or `:NewMarkdown`
- Use variables like `{{date}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{tags}}`, and `{{cursor}}`
- Position cursor exactly where needed with the `{{cursor}}` marker
- Automatic tag formatting as `[[tag]]`

Example skeleton.md template:
```markdown
---
title: {{title}}
date: {{date}}
tags: {{tags}} 
status: unread
---

# {{title}} 

{{cursor}}

## Backlinks

```

```

Use it with `:Template note.md`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure ripgrep is installed for Telescope:
   ```bash
   # Check if ripgrep is installed
   which rg
   ```

2. **Template directory not found**: Create template directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/templates
   ```

3. **Link following not working**: Check that context is set properly in mkdnflow:
   ```lua
   links = {
       context = 2,  -- Needed for multi-line links
   }
   ```

4. **Slow performance in large directories**: Adjust Telescope ignoring patterns:
   ```lua
   file_ignore_patterns = {
       ".git/", "node_modules/", "target/", 
       -- Add patterns for large directories or files
   }
   ```

5. **Avante.nvim API key issues**: Make sure you've set up your Anthropic API key:
   ```bash
   # Set environment variable
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

6. **RAG functionality not working**: Ensure your Documents directory is properly set and contains relevant files.:
